# [What's New In Angular 2][published url]
## Instructor: [Reginald Dawson][instructor url]


Angular 2 is the new version of the extremely popular AngularJS framework. AngularJS turned the front-end development world upside down when it was released, bringing together a number of new or recent web application development practices into a powerful and easy-to-use framework. With version 2, the Angular team has started from scratch with a completely new system. The ideas behind Angular are still the same, but the API and developer experience are very different.

Angular 2 is still in development, but it's stable enough for us to start learning about how to build apps with it. In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Reggie Dawson will help you get up to speed with Angular 2 before it's released.
